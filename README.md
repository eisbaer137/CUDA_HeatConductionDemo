# CUDA_HeatConductionDemo
 Simulating heat conduction equation using nVidia CUDA


It is a simulation of heat conduction equation on 2D lattice space, which shows the heat dissipating out of a square shaped material situated around the middle of the given space. Animation is done with OpenGL.

This demo is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 community version on Windows 10 home.

Test system: intel core i3-6300 with nVidia GeForce GTX 1050ti
